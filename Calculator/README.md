Thuy Lan Phan (tphan17@ucsc.edu) and Nathan Tran (ntran48@ucsc.edu)

	The lab was confusing at first, we both had to spend time to figure out C as it's unfamiliar for both of us, but Nathan also had to use Ubuntu and the Linux timeshare for the first time. He had trouble running it the first couple times, but the TAs were a great helper for resolving this issue. While Nathan was responsible for the main parts of the program, it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for Thuy Lan's understanding of the lab document. For Thuy Lan, it was definitely rather daunting at first but once she started it was easier than she expected compared to when first reading the lab document. She personally had a difficult time dealing with the divide function, as she was unsure how to deal with the situation where someone tries to divide by zero, but after reading the lab document again and some time we were able to figure it out. In total, we spent probably a couple hours on this purly coding, though a lot of time was spent reading the and understanding the lab document.
