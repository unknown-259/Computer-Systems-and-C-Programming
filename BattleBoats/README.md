The BattleBoats system could either be played by a single player vs a program, or 2 players. Single players only need one UNO board, but 2 players require two. It is similar to the game of Battle Boats where we are able to place our ships anywhere in bounds and we take turns guessing where the partner's ships are and sink all 4 ships. There are 4 modules to be completed with different purposes. The message module handles the communication between agents, the agent module is the central controller of the game logic, the field module manages the grids and tracks the position of ships, and the negotiation module manages initial turn decisions.


Something that worked well was managing my time to attend sections and get help from TAs. Though I received lots of help from TAs, something that didn't work too well was connecting my Pickit. This is due to using a usb hub and it takes a good chunk of my time disconnecting and connecting until it successfully connects. A testing strategy that I found effective was unit testing. Because I am the one writing the program, I am able to test edge cases, but it does take a bit more thinking and programming. A few things I learned from this lab is planning before programming and implementing state machines.


One thing I liked about this lab is the objective of making a well known game. This allowed me to be more appreciative of digital games and how much work is committed to program a game. One thing that I would change about this lab is the time constraint. Especially because it was near the end of the quarter, I had work and labs for other classes as well and by ending off this class with a lab that is the most time consuming lab, I was forced to give up some time in this lab.
