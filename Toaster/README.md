This lab is to recreate the modes and timing system of a toaster oven. There are three modes with the bake mode being able to adjust both the temperature and the cook time. Toast and broil has the option to only change the time. Important aspects of this lab would be understanding state machine uses as well as programming with the given hardware.


To first approach this lab, I read the whole manual first, and really tried to understand everything. This specific lab took me a bit longer to understand the manual than the previous ones. After that, I did the header file, and then worked on Lab07_main.c. One thing that went wrong when I was working on this lab was planning everything out because all the code was basically in one big file and I had to get the logic correct before I was able to do the programming. At the end, I also did the extra credit by inverting the OLED through the "alert" state. The TAs were a great help with improving my logic as well as helping me debug my code. Other than the help from the TAs, I didn't work with anyone else.


This lab finally ended successfully after about 65 hours. I definitely thought that this was a worthwhile lab, but I also thought that I put way too much time into this lab and had to turn down time for some other classes. For me, one of the hardest parts was keeping things organized because I was commenting things out in case I needed to refer back to it and at the end, I just went back and deleted all the commented code. I believe that the points distribution seems appropriate and thought that the examples in class were helpful, especially on how to brainstorm the logic.
