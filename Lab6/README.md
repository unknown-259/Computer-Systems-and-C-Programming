In this lab, we worked with microcontrollers to program switches, buttons, potentiometers, and LEDs by programming in C on MPLABX. The most important aspects of this lab would be understanding ISRs and timers. Once this concept is practiced, everything else is basically the same for loops, variables, conditions, etc., and we are then able to read sensors and manipulate our outputs.


This lab was a bit more overwhelming for me not just only because of the new hardware concepts, but also because there were a lot more files, and I took more time to think of where to start. I first started by reading the whole lab manual, then I would download files and create the ones that were required. After guidance from the TAs, I began programming the Leds_Lab06.c file and then bounce_timers.c. Soon after, I just went with the order provided in the manual for the other files. The beginning was very hectic for me because I was unclear on basically all of the programming hardware components. I only worked with the TAs during office hours and the sections for this lab, and they did a really good job on helping me understand this lab.


I am very satisfied with how my results turned out. I believe I spent about 45 hours on this lab with the biggest time consumers being learning about ISRs and timers, debugging, and getting my hardware to work properly because I was using a USB hub and it apparently sometimes messes things up. I thought that this lab was the most satisfying and the most worthwhile lab so far. I believe that the points distribution is appropriate. The lab manual did cover enough for me to get started, however, I wish we did more examples in class so that I would be more familiarized with the new concepts. However, the examples we did in class were definitely helpful, but we went through it a few days before the lab was due and we had to learn it ourselves.
