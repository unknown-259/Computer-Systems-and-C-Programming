This lab is composed of a couple of libraries and unit testings to make a calculator. The stack data structure is used to parse Reverse Polish Notation strings in order to perform operations. Aspects that I thought were important for making this lab successful were knowing how stack works, how to use the Reverse Polish Notation, and understanding pointers. Understanding stacks and Reverse Polish Notation is crucial for completing the lab, however, pointers made programming it a whole lot easier.


I first began the lab by reading everything in the manual from top to bottom. Afterwards, I got help from one of the TA's on understanding how a stack worked and then worked on the library and the unit test for that. Then, I did the same thing for the Reverse Polish Notation. Lastly, I would work on the main part where it takes in the user input and handles errors. I feel like the hardest part of the lab was near the end where error handling was needed and processing the user input. The TA's definitely helped a lot with this process of debugging and helping me understand their logic. I felt that my stack library worked quite well because I was able to understand it quickly and implement it right after.


After about 40 hours working on this lab, I am proud to say that I finished it. I liked the use of stacks and many libraries because I feel like it will be useful in careers. I however, didn't like handling errors because there were a handful of them and the manual didn't explain what each error differed from each other. I felt that this is a worthwhile lab mainly because of pointers due to the fact that I believe this is what makes the C language so powerful. I felt that the points distribution was appropriate and that the manual did cover enough for me to get started. With the deadline a little longer this time, I felt that there was more time to understand the examples in class before implementing them in my code.
